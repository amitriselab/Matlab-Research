% The function resizes the phase congruency component and concatenates them into a high dimensional feature vector
% 
% PROTOTYPE
% feature_vector = resize_pc_comps_PhD(pc, down_fak);
% 
% USAGE EXAMPLE(S)
% 
%     Example 1:
%       X=double(imread('sample_face.bmp'));
%       filter_bank = construct_Gabor_filters_PhD(8,5, [128 128]);
%       [pc,EO] = produce_phase_congruency_PhD(X,filter_bank);
%       feature_vector_extracted_from_X = resize_pc_comps_PhD(pc, 32); 
% 
%
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The function downsamples all phase congruency components in the cell 
% array pc in accordance with the specified downsampling factor down_fak. 
% After the downsampling procedure all components are converted to vector 
% form and ultimatelly concatenated into a high dimensional feature vector 
% that is returned by the function as the result.    
% 
% After downsampling the function also performs zero mean and unit variance
% normalization on the downsampled pc compnents. Note that other
% normalization techniques often give a superior result (see the
% REFERENCES). To make use of another normalization technique, you have to 
% change the source code of this function by adding an additional function 
% call to, for example, the fitt_distribution function from my INFace 
% toolbox or Matlabs histeq function.

% INPUTS:
% pc                    - a cell array of phase congruency components 
%                         computed using the produce_phase_congruency_PhD
%                         function from the PhD toolbox (obligatory
%                         argument)
% down_fak              - a scalar value determining the downsampling 
%                         factor by which to reduce the size of the original 
%                         phase congruency components; default = 1 (no 
%                         downsampling); (optional argument).
%
% OUTPUTS:
% feature_vector        - a feature vector of phase congruency features
%
