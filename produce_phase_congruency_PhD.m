% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The function computes phase congruency features from an input image X 
% using a precomputed filter bank of complex Gabor filters (created with 
% the construct_Gabor_filters_PhD function). Optionally, the nscale 
% argument can be used to specifically set the number of scales over which 
% to compute the phase congruency features. The function outputs two cell 
% arrays, where the first (i.e., pc) contains the phase congruency of the 
% input image for each of the filter orientation in the filter bank and the 
% second contains the complex Gabor reponses of the filtering operation. 
% Hence, the second output cell array EO contains a similar result as the 
% filtered_image that represents the output of the filter_image_with_Gabor_bank_PhD
% function called with a downsampling factor of 1. The only difference here 
% is that this function returns a cell array with the compley responses 
% in image form (and no downsampling), while the filter_image_with_Gabor_bank_PhD
% function returns (potentially downsampled) magnitude reponses concatenated 
% into a large feature vector.

%
% INPUTS:
% X                     - an input grey-scale face image (obligatory
%                         argument)
% filter_bank           - a filter bank of coplex Gabor filters created
%                         using the construct_Gabor_filters_PhD function
%                         from the PhD toolbox (obligatory
%                         argument)
% nscale                - a scalar value determining the number of scales
%                         over which to compute phase congrunecy; note that
%                         this value can in general be smaller than the
%                         number of filter scales available in the 
%                         filter_bank structure; if no value is specified,
%                         the default (i.e., filter_bank.scales) is used 
%                         (optional parameter)
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% pc                    - a cell array of size 1 x no_of_orient; where 
%                         no_of_orient is the umber of orientations for
%                         which the phase congrunecy was computed; each
%                         entry in the array corresponds to the pahse
%                         congrunecy in a specific orinetation
% EO                    - a cell array of complex Gabor filter reponses of
%                         size (nscale x orentations); where nscale stands
%                         for the number of Gabor filter scales used in the 
%                         computation (see third input parameter) and 
%                         orentations stands for the number of filter
%                         orientations in the employed Gabor filter bank
%
